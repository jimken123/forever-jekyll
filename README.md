# README

This repo is a fork of [Forever Jekyll - A simple, elegant & full featured Jekyll theme](https://forever-jekyll.github.io) and, minimalist at that origin repo is, I've removed a bunch of stuff that I don't need.

I am using it to migrate my **/ohpiglet** blog away from WordPress and into Jekyll

For now this repo builds at [jimken123.github.io/forever-jekyll/](jimken123.github.io/forever-jekyll/) but eventually it will go to [mananamanana.com/ohpiglet/](mananamanana.com/ohpiglet/).

## Notes to self

Images display easily using this code:

  ```
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image/404.jpg)
  ```

## Build locally first

 ```
jekyll serve
 ```

## TODO

### Add favicons

### Enable comments

### Enable web analytics
